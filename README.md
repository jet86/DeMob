# DeMob
Chrome Extension to automatically convert mobile URLs to desktop versions.

Currently it redirects manually added domains.

# Installation

## Manual Installation and Updates

* Download this repository to your computer (and unzip it if it downloads as a zip file)
* Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions
* Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**
* Click the **LOAD UNPACKED** button and select the extension directory

## Installation from the Chrome Extension Store

This will be available once the extension has reached a sufficiently stable development

# Roadmap

* v0.4 (Optionally) automatically remove "m." or "mobile." at the beginning of a URL
* v0.6 Allow users to submit a domain from the extension to Github as an issue
* v0.8 Allow users to add custom domains locally, rather than requiring it be added to the inbuilt list
