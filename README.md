# DeMob
Chrome Extension to automatically convert mobile URLs to desktop versions.

Currently it redirects manually added domains.

# Roadmap:

* Automatically remove "m." or "mobile." at the beginning of a URL
* Allow users to submit a domain from the extension to Github as an issue
* Allow users to add custom domains locally, rather than requiring it be added to the inbuilt list
