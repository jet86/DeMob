# DeMob
Chrome Extension to automatically convert mobile URLs to desktop versions.

Currently it redirects manually added domains.

# Installation

## Manual Installation and Updates

* Download this repository to your computer (and unzip it if it downloads as a zip file)
* Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions
* Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**
* Click the **LOAD UNPACKED** button and select the extension directory

## Installation from the Chrome Extension Store

This will be available once the extension has reached a sufficiently stable development

# Adding sites/domains to be redirected

Please [edit hotlist.js](https://github.com/jet86/DeMob/edit/master/hostlist.js) and submit a pull request

# Roadmap

* v0.3 (Optionally) automatically remove "m." or "mobile." at the beginning of a URL
* v0.4 Allow users to submit a domain from the extension to Github as an issue
* v1.0 Added to Chrome Extension webstore
* v2.0 Allow users to add custom domains locally, rather than requiring it be added to the inbuilt list
